## Overview
The Aim is to detect Heart Disease at initial stage before it get Chronic and compare machine learning models for predicting heart diesaese based on the clonical data provided by UCI Machine Learning Laboratoary.it uses algorithm like as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost to classify whether patient has heart disease.

## DataSet
the dataset contain clinical data and features like age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholestrol level, and others. along with a target variable indicating the presence ofo heart disesase. the data does not contain missing values and has been processed for medeling.

## Features
<ul>
    <li>Age </li>
    <li>Sex</li>
    <li>chest pain</li>
    <li>resting blood pressure</li>
    <li>cholestrol</li>
    <li>fasting blood pressure</li>
    <li>resting ECG result</li>
    <li>Maximum hesart rate</li>
    <li>Exercise Induced Angina</li>
    <li>Thal</li>
</ul>

## Machine Learning Model used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting 
XGBoost
LightGBM
CatBoost

## Getting Started 
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.15
- Libraires: pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Matplotlin, Seaborn

### Installation
Install required Python pakages using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the project
1. Load and Preprocess the dataset
2. split the dataset into trainning and test sets.
3. Train each machine learning 
4. Evaluate and compare model performance usning the accuracy and classificaton 
5. Visualize comparison result
